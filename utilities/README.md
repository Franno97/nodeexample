# Node.js Examples: Utilities

In this directory, we have examples of utilities that are useful for Node.js development. See the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is a Utility in the context of nodejs/examples

Any module that is helpful in simplifying tasks that you'll encounter in Node.js. For example:

- Utility libraries (Lodash, Underscore) that help simplify common operations
- Single purpose libraries (Moment, node-fetch) that solve a problem particularly well
