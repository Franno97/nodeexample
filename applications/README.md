# Node.js Examples: Applications

In this directory, we have examples of Applications that are built with or extensively leverage Node.js. See the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is an Application in the context of nodejs/examples

Anything that can be considered a standalone application. For example:

- Desktop applications that bundle or otherwise use Node.js
- Mobile applications that leverage Node.js
- Other bundled applications that can be run as a standalone executable
