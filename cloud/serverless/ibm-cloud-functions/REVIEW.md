# Review: Create and invoke actions

1. If you were to execute the following command which invokes a Hello World action:

<p><code>ibmcloud fn action invoke hello</code></p>

it would return with an activation ID and an HTTP response generated by the function.

(!) True
(x) False

[explanation]
False. The command did not use the <code>--blocking</code> flag so only an activation ID would be returned.  A separate command would be needed against the activation ID to retrieve the response which would be available after the function completed execution.
[explanation]

2. When invoking actions, parameter values can be any valid JSON value, including nested objects.

(x) True
(!) False

[explanation]
True. You are able to pass nested JSON objects when invoking actions using the command line. <p>For example:
<code>ibmcloud fn action invoke add-job -p job '{"area": "marketing", "title": "director"}'</code>
</p>
[explanation]

3. It is not possible to monitor activation logs in real time using the command line.

(!) True
(x) False

[explanation]
False. You simply need to issue the <code>poll</code> command for activations as follows:
<p><code>ibmcloud fn activation poll</code></p>
[explanation]

4. It is impossible to perform a blocking invocation on an asynchronous action.

(!) True
(x) False

[explanation]
False. Using `Promises` in Node.js, it is possible for your function to return while waiting for the result of the promise.
[explanation]

5. If an action in the middle of a sequence fails, the platform will return the error after the last action in the sequence is invoked.

(!) True
(x) False

[explanation]
False. The platform will return the error from the failing action immediately.
