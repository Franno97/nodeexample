# Node.js Examples: Cloud

In this directory, we have examples of using Node.js with technologies that are related to the cloud. See the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is Cloud in the context of nodejs/examples

Anything that is related to deployment of Node.js applications to the cloud. For example:

- Containers (Docker, Google Cloud Run)
- Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, [IBM Cloud Functions](serverless/ibm-cloud-functions/README.md), MS Azure Functions, OpenFaaS, Serverless Framework)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform)
- Cloud-specific (Alibaba Cloud, AWS, DigitalOcean, GCP, IBM Cloud, MS Azure, Oracle Cloud)
- Edge / Tiny Clouds (Begin, CloudFlare Workers, Glitch, Heroku, Netlify, Now, Surge)
