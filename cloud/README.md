# Node.js Examples: Cloud

In this directory, we have examples of using Node.js with technologies that are related to the cloud. See the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is Cloud in the context of nodejs/examples

Anything that is related to deployment of Node.js applications to the cloud. For example:

- Containers (Docker)
- Serverless (Serverless Framework, OpenFaaS, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Run, Azure Functions)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes, Terraform, OpenShift)
- Cloud-specific (AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM Cloud, DigitalOcean, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud)
- Tiny Clouds (Netlify, Now, Glitch, CloudFlare Workers, Heroku, Surge, Begin)
